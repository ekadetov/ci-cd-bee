# üêù ‚Äì Like a busy bee helping with your builds and deploys. 

`cicd-bee` is a small demo project for how to use Vertex AI in common CI/CD tasks.

It uses Vertex AI to analyze code changes (in the form of a GitDiff) and generate the following outputs:
- Summary of the changes to help speed up a MR/PR review
- PR/MR comments for code changes to provide initial feedback to the author
- Release Notes for changes for code changes

To integrate directly with a PR/MR flow it uses the Gitlab or GitHub API to:
- Comment on an issue
- Comment on a PR or MR

The cicd-bee can be used in the following ways:
- as a standalone python application
- as a container image 
- in a container-based CI/CD pipeline such as Cloud Build

## Getting Started

To use the `cicd-bee` as a container image you'll need to build and run the image:

```sh
docker build . -t cicd-bee
docker run cicd-bee --help
```

To use the `cicd-bee` as a python application you'll need to install the dependencies and then run the application:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cicd-bee.py --help
```

To use the `cicd-bee` in a Cloud Build pipeline you'll need to build the image and then submit a pipeline that uses it.

```sh
# adapt these with your values
PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
REGION=europe-west1
REPO_NAME=default
IMAGE_PATH="$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$REPO_NAME/cicd-bee"

gcloud builds submit . --substitutions "_IMAGE_PATH=$IMAGE_PATH"
gcloud builds submit --config ./docs/demo-pipeline/print-cli-help.yaml --substitutions "_IMAGE_PATH=$IMAGE_PATH"
```

In all of these cases you should see the following help output:

```txt
